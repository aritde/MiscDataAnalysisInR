# MiscDataAnalysisInR

This repository contains some of the codes which I had written to perform some basic data data anlysis on simple data sets while learning R.

Problem 1 :
Data set :Iris

a) Calculates the average value and standard deviation for each of the four features.
b) Repeats the previous step but separately for each type of flower.
c) Draws four box plots, one for each feature, such that each figure shows three boxes, one for each type of flower. 

The data set Iris can be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. 


Problem 2:
a) Provides pairwise scatter plots for four most correlated and four least correlated pairs of features, using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient. 

b) Uses Euclidean distance to find the closest example to every example available in the data set (excluding the class variable). Calculates the percentage of points whose closest neighbors have the same class label (for data set as a whole and also for each class).

c) Repeats the previous step but after the data set is normalized using first 0-1 normalization and then z-score normalization. 

the data set Wine can be downloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine.
